            <h2>Smokey Steak</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the sliders at White Manna in Hackensack, New Jersey, Adam Fleischman creates beef patties by flattening balls of ground meat on the griddle.Tip: Steak purists handle ground meat as little as possible; over-working the beef can create a tight, meatloaf texture.</p>

            <h2>Vegetable Salad</h2>
            <p>For a pleasing side to any meal, serve Roasted Vegetable Salad. Roasting enhances the flavor of these vegetables that are then tossed in a fresh basil and sesame-ginger dressing, allowing flavors to mingle.</p>
